# NETFLIX-CLONE-With-Html-and-css
Happy developer.
I made the decision to create a page for this project that had features in common with Netflix's home page. After taking a quick course on frontend web development and gaining a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, I made the decision to take on this project.

I added some photos to the files mentioned above to make them functional, and these images must be loaded inside the html code.

Here is the link to the images: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OeMF3nGzdJ0MYMEISOyQNLD2Ma6rm2a_?usp=sharing
