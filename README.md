# NETFLIX-CLONE-With-Html-and-css
Happy developer.
I made the decision to create a page for this project that had features in common with Netflix's home page. After taking a quick course on frontend web development and gaining a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS, I made the decision to take on this project.

#Happycoding!
